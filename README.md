Mono repository to manage infrastructure present at my home

> Consider [contributing](#how-to-contribute)

## üìñ Overview

This is how I manage my home lab. From infrastructure code managing base things such as: internal domains in the router 
or VMs on hypervisor; to how I manage Kubernetes clusters over that. Glue automations between all the technologies 
are covered too, as I'm too lazy to do the same twice.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud resources

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted, I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. 
This saves me from having to worry about several things:

* Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios
* Services I critically need to monitor my cluster

The alternative solution to these problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications 
like [Hashicorp Vault], [Ntfy], and [Gatus]. 

However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort, 
which is not worth for a homelab.

| Service      | Use                                           | Cost         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [Gitlab]     | Storing Terraform states. Storing secrets (*) | Free         |
| [Cloudflare] | Domain, DNS and proxy management              | Free         |
| [GitHub]     | Hosting this repository and CI/CD             | Free         |
|              |                                               | Total: $0/mo |

* *: This repo uses **Gitlab project's CI/CD variables** as a vault for infrastructure secrets, as Gitlab allows 
  to store and retrieve them by calling the API.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure

I use [Terraform] to provision resources in several systems. 

Some of them, need credentials. To know how credentials are retrieved, see [Cloud Resources](#-cloud-resources)

> Due to recent changes in the Terraform license, this repository will use [OpenTofu]
> in the near future as a replacement.

### Terragrunt

[Terragrunt] is a Terraform wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping Terraform configurations dry. 

This allowed me to improve the UX related to how Terraform use environment variables or state backends
and do less dirty tricks on Terraform code.

### Router

Code is used to manage router's stuff related to my rack. The key is treating the router as a networking cloud provider.

* Internal domains assigned to specific machines: 
  * ARM64 SBCs, hypervisor, VMs: `compute-xx.internal.place`
  * NAS: `storage-xx.internal.place`

* Internal domains assigned to Kubernetes
  * Ingress Controller `*.tools.internal.place`

* Firewall rules: forward Wireguard traffic to Wireguard server

* More things in the future. Some of them are already configured (ie: BGP to point k8s LBs to the right machines) but
  provider currently in use is not supporting them yet. 

This could change in the future as it depends on the evolution of this [OPNsense Terraform provider]:

You can inspect the code [here](infrastructure/terraform/opnsense)

### Virtual Machines

Code is also used to create VMs on the hypervisor. Hypervisor is using very simple and robust virtualization
technologies like KVM, Qemu and Libvirt. The main advantage of managing it directly with code is using most
available resources for the actual VMs.

VMs are managed using [metal-cloud], a module crafted on my own to declare groups of VMs with ease on hosts that are 
using that stack. Actually, I use [a copy](infrastructure/terraform/modules/vms). This allows myself to do 
modifications and experiments to improve the module I release publicly.

You can inspect the code [here](infrastructure/terraform/vms)

## üê≥ Kubernetes

My clusters are currently using [k0s], and configuration is applied using [k0sctl], as it allows to declare a whole cluster
as a YAML manifest.

### Primary

Primary cluster is called `kubernetes-01`, and is running on bare ARM64 machines as power consumption and noise are lower.

This is a really reliable cluster as each node is an individual machine, cluster is having 3 masters, independent 
power supplies, etc. The main drawback is not being possible to install every Linux distribution as SBCs use weird 
bootloaders and some specific drivers are not in the upstream kernel yet. This limits what k8s distro can be used.

### Secondary

Secondary cluster is called `kubernetes-02` and is provisioned overtop ubuntu VMs as a powerful alternative for 
doing crazy experiments before optimizing whatever is needed.

This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads are sharing the same available resources while I have a separate 
server for data storage.

## ü§ñ Automations

It's a super common practise to use a makefile and Bash scripts to automate everything. 
However, this is not the best way to manage automations for this repository, as there are modern ways to 
do exactly the same. The requirements for a candidate are:

* Able to use Bash scripts where needed
* Replacing makefile with something easier to read
* Using YAML manifests

Bingo! I decided to use [Taskfile]

Just install the CLI from its [releases page](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases) and execute the following
command from the root of the repository to list available tasks I have created for this repository:

```console
task -l
```

To see the scripts executed under the hoods, it's only needed to look into the right [place](Taskfile.yaml) 
(or [places](.taskfiles))

The way I organized the files implies being able to execute commands present on files into [.taskfiles](.taskfiles) 
directory in an independent way. At the same time, they can be combined to craft complex commands in the global scope. 
This complex commands is what I call `glue` commands.
This way things are not mixed everywhere.

## How to use it

Every good story starts with something small. This time is about bootstrapping everything that is needed: 

```console
task global:init
```

After that, it's needed to connect with Gitlab

```console
task gitlab:login
```

What about getting some superpowers to provision infrastructure getting secrets from Gitlab?

```console
task gitlab:generate-supertoken TOKEN_NAME=supertoken

task terragrunt:apply-opnsense GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN_NAME=supertoken
task terragrunt:apply-vms GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN_NAME=supertoken
```

The story ending is about discovery the rest of really well documented tasks

```console
task -l
```

Once you have finished, don't forget about revoking your superpowers

```console
task gitlab:revoke-token TOKEN_NAME=supertoken
task global:cleanup
```

## How to contribute

This repository is the final result of continuous failures so is intended to be used as a reference. 
Because of that, code collaborations are not allowed at this point, but there are other ways to collaborate:

* üîñ Open issues to discuss what can be improved
* üß≤ Fork the repository: use it or modify it for your own infrastructure with the half of the effort
* üåü Give a star to make it more visible to others
